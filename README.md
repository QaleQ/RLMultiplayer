Batch script for making it easier to play Workshop maps online

This script lets you use the BakkesMod console (F6 in game) to host- or connect to servers playing- Workshop maps, provided both the host and the client has applied this script, and have subscribed to the map in question in the Steam Workshop.


What it does (short version):
Creates symlinks for each .udk file in your workshop map folder substructure as .upk files inside your Rocket League folder,
to trick the game into loading them as normal maps when the game starts.
